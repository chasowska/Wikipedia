I continue to study HTML and CSS, as well as practice.
The [last website](https://github.com/chasowska/kostenko) I developed took quite a
long time (approximately 4-5 days). I constantly referred to Google searches, even for elementary
questions (thanks to MDN Web Docs and W3Schools for existing üôè). During creation the
second website, it became easier to get the basics. I've decided now not to create the design
myself, but to find a ready-made solution on Dribbble. Sometimes there, creators make not just
website designs, but real challenges for developers üòÖ. So, I was very excited to try and create
something similar.

The task for the challenge, as before, was taken
from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/html-and-css-code-challenges-for-beginners/).
It reads as follows:

### Create a Wikipedia page

Wikipedia is one of the backbones of the internet, and it has a relatively simple layout. Create a
Wikipedia page on the topic of your choice. It should include:

- A title or heading
- A table of contents with links to sections within the page
- Superscript number links that link to the corresponding number in the reference section
- An ordered list of references

### My personal tasks

1. Create a page divided into 2 blocks (contents and article).
2. Fix the contents so that it remains stationary when scrolling.
3. Learn to create custom sub-lists within `li`.
4. Add auto-scroll when clicking on any item in the contents.
5. Learn to create a quote with the addition of images in the background.
