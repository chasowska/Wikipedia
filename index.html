                            <p>Kuzmenko's life heavily revolved around Skryabin during this period.
                                In
                                2000, he became a presenter of his own hit parade "Hot Seven", which
                                lasted until 2002. Beginning around 2003, Kuzmenko worked as a
                                presenter
                                of the programs "Chance" and "Shikanemo" with singer Natalia

                                He was given all control of management over Skryabin, and began to

                                the band in a sonically new direction. In 2006, Kuzmenko published

                                autobiography, titled "Me, Pobeda and Berlin". The book was wildly
                                popular, and has been reprinted several times since then. In 2009,

                                before his death, Kuzmenko strongly criticized the current

                                whom Andriy personally knew. She studied at the <a

                            <p>Mother - Olga Mykhailivna Kuzmenko, a piano teacher at a music

                            <p>According to Andriy, in 2004, he was forced to perform concerts in
                                support of the presidential candidate <a

                            </p>
                            <p>Later, Kuzmenko took an active political stance, which he often
                                expressed
                                in interviews. He consistently provided financial assistance to the
                                soldiers of the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) and was known for
                                occasionally visiting the hospital where the soldiers were treated.
                                Andriy explained that after being wounded, a soldier becomes
                                uninteresting to the state, and everyone turns away from him, so
                                it's
                                extremely important to communicate with veterans. Andriy Kuzmenko
                                consistently criticized the activities of Ukrainian politicians.</p>

                                Ukraine,
                                commenting on what he saw outside the window, such as the terrible
                                quality of the roads, potholes, flooding, lack of repairs, etc. In
